How to install xcgal
====================

xcgal is installed as a regular XOOPS module, which means you should copy 
the complete /xcgal folder into the /modules directory of your website. 
Then log in as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the 
xcgal icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. 
Follow the directions on the screen.
