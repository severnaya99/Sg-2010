This is a new spanish XFSections/WFSections translation based on the english sources.  

As far as I see it, it's -necessary- because:

The spanish translations I've reviewed out there are outdated. (Missing english constants)

The updates are dificult. Constants in diferent order cause diff tools to get confused.

IMO they are not coherent. The same entity is refered with multiple terms. (Tópico, Tema, Categoría, Sección)

And why XFS? Because this translations is good for both WFS and XFS, plus the new features of XFS (Thanks OHWADA)

Finally spanish Latin America specifics.
